Tom gave me something to read.
It's dangerous to swim in this river.
You're just a coward.
Mary treated her wounded knee.
Let's play tennis in the afternoon.
Help me.
New Year's Day is close at hand.
I want to marry a girl like her.
She caught colds often.
He is old enough to understand it.
I'll call you as soon as I can.
She gets good marks in English.
My sister married a doctor.
I can't believe that.
What language do you think this is?
I want to drink something cold.
He often eats fish for dinner.
Please be quiet, everybody.
Who can do this work?
She has a real knack for getting people to do what she wants.
Tom wished he hadn't borrowed the book from Mary.
I'd like to go.
Tom hitched a ride to Boston.
We probably don't have enough time to finish doing that today.
It is true that television also has some disadvantages.
He doesn't have a job. He's retired.
How long did you live there?
Since he has ambitions, he works hard.
Don't fail to mail this letter.
As far as I know, she is still missing.
You chose this job yourself, right?
How much is the rent per month?
He flew a kite with his son.
It's a pleasure to have you with us again.
Our house was robbed while we were away.
You can dig dirt from the ground.
How's your wife, Tom?
Tom was the last one to get in the van.
It is not easy to speak English.
That's exactly what I wanted to see happen.
Give me the number.
I can hardly see without my glasses.
No, I didn't write it.
Why did you run away?
Let's get together again!
I opened the box and looked inside.
I don't know what Tom got.
Well, let's get going!
The sky grew darker and darker.
Tom comes home almost every weekend.
Tom closed his eyes and began to count sheep.
All of these books are mine.
She always looked happy, but never was.
We speak the same language, don't we?
My father will retire at the age of sixty.
Can you give me your phone number?
He likes taking a walk by himself.
I've been robbed.
I asked twenty friends to the party.
I'm as hungry as a horse.
I can't believe Tom is really planning to do this.
They settled in the country.
Who are you working for?
They'll get out of class in forty minutes.
We toured all the major cities.
Don't forget to put the fire out.
Water boils at one hundred degrees.
Why are you burning these pictures?
Do you have a bike?
She was arrested by the police.
Tom finished college last year.
Tom told me that he thought that Mary used to live in Boston.
He was named after his grandfather.
I said open the door.
The coffee is cold.
You must keep quiet for a few days.
Tom's parents weren't particularly pleased.
We accept checks.
Tom is out cold.
After dinner, I did my homework.
My purse was stolen.
Driving on a slippery road can lead to a car wreck.
He showed interest in the plan.
We're getting a new car next month.
A stitch in time saves nine.
To my surprise, he was good at singing.
The building is under construction.
I don't know what the next step is.
This theory is very controversial.
Everyone who knew him admired him.
Clean the dirt off the mirror.
Do you have a TV?
He pretended to be a doctor.
We're throwing a party Friday evening at our place.
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
She's really smart, isn't she?
I bought some clothes.
She told me once and for all that she did not want to see me again.
Let's go there.
I'm tired of translating.
My brother seems to enjoy himself at college.
How do you feel?
We've been asked to not do this anymore.
Tom has three other dogs.
The boy made his parents happy.
Tom went down the hill.
I have no strength.
What did you say your name was?
Is your school far from your home?
Tom doesn't even have a driver's license.
She worked from morning till night.
My brother wants to study abroad.
Where is Tom's classroom?
Some people eat sushi with their hands.
Tom was killed in an accident.
I spoke with him about the matter.
We'll buy a new car next week.
It was not until I reached home that I missed my purse.
It worried me that she looked pale.
Come and dance with me.
She can't play the piano very well.
Somebody has stolen my hair dryer.
She's leaving the country in six months.
Tom is your age.
Let's wait here till he comes back.
Will you please show me the way?
I must go now.
No way!
We'll find some other way to do that.
How many Chinese characters can you write?
The box is too heavy to carry.
These questions are easy to answer.
He can't help you.
Can I take pictures here?
Tom bought some flowers for Mary.
Let me give you a lift as far as the station.
I'm not afraid to die.
It's human nature.
I've lost patience with Tom.
Please keep me informed.
What is your greatest source of inspiration?
The room was illuminated with red lights.
I make a point of being punctual.
It was just a dream.
I created an archive of my emails.
I get up at six.
He is not what he used to be.
Tom is building a house.
I can't remember the meaning of the word that I looked up yesterday.
Today is my treat.
Didn't you write a letter to him?
She is good at playing tennis.
You're very fast.
I object to her going there alone.
I sure hope this is a dream.
How long can it be kept going with 100 dollars?
She smiled.
There was complete silence.
I love my yellow sweater.
He tried speaking French to us.
Did anybody ask you to come here?
I can't swim well.
As for me, I have nothing to say.
I met Mary yesterday.
I believe in you.
I owe you so much.
Tom doesn't know why Mary is absent.
Tom has many friends living in Boston.
Please have a drink.
Did you play tennis yesterday?
Mutual understanding promotes peace.
I thought it was very good.
Have fun.
Tom didn't like the idea.
Tom is drinking some water.
He hit his head against a rock.
I can't make an exception.
She'll love her husband forever.
Do you eat out often?
I'm still the boss here.
This matter is very urgent.
She was wearing pumps.
He is full of energy.
It snowed.
They have twelve children.
She was promoted.
The gang was planning a robbery.
You should've turned left.
Give me five more minutes.
I have no time.
The whole process will take months.
"Did he write a letter yesterday?" "Yes, he did."
You should keep your promise.
I seem to have a temperature.
Which do you prefer, rice or bread?
I'm a little bit concerned.
He went by bicycle.
You're working too hard. Take it easy for a while.
It's spring.
He sent me a birthday card.
Please help yourself to some fruit.
This car is easy to handle.
I work best under pressure.
There was nobody in the garden.
He was snoring loudly while he slept.
I found a taxi, but there was no driver inside.
Nobody likes war.
Tom didn't come after all.
You must pay in advance.
You could have done it.
I made my way through the crowd.
You only gave me fifty cents.
Mind your manners.
You'll love it.
She is better at speaking English than any of her classmates.
Could you please drive me home?
I took my shoes off and put them under the bed.
There were a lot of people in the park.
The curtains make this room beautiful.
Tom isn't interested in Mary at all.
My room is twice as big as his.
To tell the truth, I don't like him.
You're free to go.
"What's in that box?" "Nothing."
I was asked to wait here.
I'm beginning to remember it.
He was aware that I was around, but didn't come to greet me.
It might be a wedding.
How tall is your youngest brother?
His advice didn't help at all.
I'd rather you stayed at home.
Even when I was a child, I was able to swim well.
I don't know where Tom was going.
Tom has low blood pressure.
The living room adjoins the dining room.
When will you come back to school?
I've never underestimated Tom.
Do you think that he is equal to the task?
I want to study French.
Let's eat now. I'm dying of hunger.
They married when they were young.
I can't let you give me your last ten dollars.
The teacher made us repeat the word.
Tom said Mary is shy.
You're stepping into dangerous territory.
Have you found your contact lenses?
I hope you don't die.
Tom is very kind.
Please sit down.
You can't fire us.
The air conditioner doesn't work.
How many plates do we have?
He walked past the house.
The house is burning.
Imagine that you have a time machine.
I am grateful to you for your kindness.
Close the door, please.
When can you come to my home?
Tom isn't as innocent as he seems.
Dear Santa, I want a girlfriend for Christmas.
He has made the baseball team.
He gave him a book.
I'm Tom's father.
I wish that I could speak French better.
I agree with you on this point.
I haven't eaten for many days.
The cat is eating.
I didn't like beer at that time.
He will travel abroad next year.
I'd like to change yen to dollars.
You didn't tell me Mary was so beautiful.
Are you new?
Maybe I'll just give up soon and take a nap instead.
I caught him by the arm before he could fall.
Today is my sister's birthday.
I provided him with food.
His new car is wonderful.
What's the number?
Are you good at mathematics?
I need you to promise that you'll do what I ask you to do.
At last, the bus stopped.
Tom will likely never do that again.
I gazed at the sea for hours.
How much is this pen?
I asked him for a favor.
I'm very sleepy.
I didn't think Tom would be scared.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
Tom goes for a walk every morning.
Buy milk on your way home.
This isn't love.
The main question is how does Tom feel.
Everybody knows his name.
This is the house where she used to live.
You shouldn't eat here.
We have barely enough bread for breakfast.
Don't leave the TV on.
Do you often hear from him?
A good idea occurred to him.
I will find you a good doctor.
Money can't buy happiness.
There's been a death in his family.
Do you feel tired?
You can visit me whenever you want.
Computers are capable of doing extremely complicated work.
It's very hot today, isn't it?
Mary won't listen to her friend's advice.
I believe that story.
I can't understand this at all.
Would you like to come?
All good things must come to an end.
I didn't go to school yesterday.
I walked three-fourths of a mile.
This wine tastes great.
I cried, too.
All men are created equal.
Put your hands up!
I'm not used to speaking in public.
I tried to tell you.
Tom is in the shower.
I'm thirty years old now.
How are you all?
Be friendly.
Don't you love each other?
I'm glad that you guys are here.
The situation is worse than I'd thought.
Where are you going?
You'd better put on a raincoat.
I'll always love you, no matter what happens.
Both Tom and Mary can speak French.
Where's the kitchen?
He always tells the truth.
Get into your car.
There is a cup on the table.
I do not know whether to accept or to refuse.
I can't swim at all.
Who do you think they were?
The mirror was shattered.
He knows who they are.
I don't like the taste of tomatoes.
The fight is over.
She has had to stay here.
You're welcome.
Please turn down the radio.
Could you come to tomorrow's meeting?
Our child likes dogs, but I prefer cats.
If she was displeased, she never showed it.
She raised her voice.
Tom lost his balance and fell.
Here comes the train.
He gave his life for his country.
Please do that.
Well, have you decided?
We'd better talk.
She was out of Japan last year.
I got on the wrong train.
Why are you wearing that scarf?
That wasn't the main reason that Tom needed to do that.
I told him what the problem was.
Whether you like it or not doesn't matter.
Do you have younger brothers?
I wish I were a good singer.
I want you.
I want it to be different this time.
I recognised him immediately.
Tom went over and sat down next to Mary.
He came back last August.
It's very hot in this room.
I lost my inspiration.
Tom has three cats.
There's no use crying over spilt milk.
He has been very busy this week.
Tom has absolutely no enemies.
Your shirt is unbuttoned.
I've been looking for a new job for a long time.
Tom wondered where Mary had learned French.
He is just my age.
Have you seen all these movies?
Tom worries about making mistakes at work.
I hope Tom loses.
I don't feel like studying English today.
He is a member of the baseball club.
He climbed the stairs.
They kept on walking.
He got off at the next station.
I can't concentrate on my work because of the noise.
That man died of lung cancer a week ago.
I'm very interested in jazz.
Tom taught me many things.
He died of lung cancer.
Stop fooling around.
We were on the train for ten hours.
Tom fell into a vat of sulfuric acid.
Mary didn't recognize her ex-husband.
I am going out this afternoon.
Tom couldn't go to the concert because he had to work.
Tom is old enough to go to school.
Her older daughter is married.
You ought to let Tom know Mary is going to do that.
I have lost my cap.
Tom used to wear glasses.
Leave more space between the lines.
I wonder what the weather will be tomorrow.
I bought a hat at the store.
It's only your imagination.
Are you planning on eating that all by yourself?
I caught him stealing the money.
Tom failed.
We're all hungry.
Tom talked about his school.
To master English is hard.
There were two cakes.
You are in a safe place.
I'm good at skiing.
You'll be confused.
I went to the park last Sunday.
The Amazon is fed by a large number of tributaries.
Tom happened to meet Mary at the supermarket.
He was watching TV last night.
She's my classmate.
She was very embarrassed when her child behaved badly in public.
Do you often travel abroad?
The old man is blind in one eye.
Carrots cost three dollars.
She had already gone to bed when I phoned her at 11:00 p.m.
The girl resembled her mother.
Could I park my car here?
Do you eat pasta?
I got your fax the other day.
That house is big.
Don't look into my room.
They always complain.
Are you single?
It is dangerous to jump onto a moving train.
Have you traveled anywhere recently?
A doctor told me that eating eggs was bad for me.
When water freezes it becomes ice.
Was that what Tom said?
Tom is sitting on the grass.
She didn't like her husband.
I'd like to show you something.
He's going to have a heart attack.
Where do you suppose you'll spend your vacation?
You're really wonderful.
Winners don't use drugs.
Can you eat this?
I've known her for a long time.
He attributes his success to good luck.
That's very big.
We enjoyed ourselves at the picnic.
Give me a glass of water, please.
I am in Tokyo today.
It is rude to point at others.
How long is this?
Did I miss the party?
My briefcase is full of papers.
I'll never allow you to do that.
All I want is my freedom.
We talked over the phone.
I need another pillow.
It's still too early to talk about this now.
You have many books.
Tom is fluent in three languages.
He took it literally.
It was too difficult for me.
I hope he'll be able to come! I'd like to see him.
He's bound to notice your mistake.
We're out of stock now.
Tom turned up the TV.
Don't put anything on top of the box.
That's Tom's mother.
When do you practice the piano?
She looks unhappy.
Japan depends on other countries for oil.
The light is on.
I gave Tom one of those.
They're all innocent children.
I need to complete it as soon as possible.
He survived an accident last year, but still drives recklessly.
I think I'm intelligent.
Tom hung the calendar on the wall.
He lives by himself.
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
I can do that for Tom.
This problem is too difficult for primary school children to solve.
Do you have a list of hotels?
Tom realized that he had lost his wallet.
Tom and I were business partners.
It's you I've come for.
Is this book yours?
Keep listening.
Write your name in capitals.
How do you like it?
My father is very angry with me.
She got sick this weekend.
It stopped snowing an hour ago.
I used to go out with friends every weekend.
Do you understand French?
She had a new dress made.
Why are you here?
Does she have a piano?
I'll go by taxi.
He will be back soon.
I do all the work.
My house is just across the street.
I don't drink coffee at all.
What did Tom expect Mary to do?
We were all pretty shocked.
He belongs to the camera club.
My uncle runs a hotel.
It's time to eat lunch.
Tom was on the list.
He began to sweat.
Tom will be there for a few days.
How often does the bus run?
Call me when you get settled in.

Keep reading.
I do not doubt it in the least.
I could see that.
I like you.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
There's a book here.
One more bottle of wine, please.
I want to go skating.
I'm afraid there isn't any coffee left.
Go straight home.
Repairs will cost a lot of money.
Phone me tomorrow at nine.
He has been dead for ten years.
You don't understand.
Tom is still sitting in the waiting room.
You ought to have come to see me yesterday.
I just threw up.
He made an important discovery.
You don't get up as early as your sister, do you?
Your mother is in critical condition.
I'm just a plain old office worker.
The recent advances in medicine are remarkable.
He wouldn't listen to my advice.
It's time to get some work done.
I ate caviar.

I arrived here yesterday.
Don't underestimate my power.

It looks like the dog wants something to eat.
My shoulder hurts.
Tom moves quickly.
Could you say that one more time?
He's very straightforward.
I like pizza very much.
I'm serious.
Nobody knows the truth.
I was alone in the classroom.
A beautiful lake lay just beyond the forest.
She ironed his shirts.
Do you have a better explanation?
You look as healthy as ever.
Tom wants to see you.
Please tell me Tom is OK.
Listen.
I think that it's true.
He gave in.
I want to be a baseball player.
That’s what we heard.
The conflict between blacks and whites in the city became worse.
He hit the ball with his racket.

She began to like him right away.
He gave her a piece of advice.
They're trying to keep costs down.
Tom has been struck by lightning three times.
I think we shouldn't let Tom do that again.
Don't forget Tom is allergic to peanuts.

Turn the radio down a little.
Have you met her before?
He is playing music.
Come with me.
Please wait a moment.
She is going to Sendai this spring.
I love my life.
I wish you success.
He objected to our plan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
I spoke to Tom last night.
I thought that Tom had a soccer game tonight.
Everybody is supposed to know the law, but few people really do.
I share a bedroom with my sister.

What time do you open?
She called me many times.

Keep Tom safe.
I'd bought it the week before.

I wish he were here now.
It is raining.
Can we lock this door?
I was very impressed by his story.
Doesn't Tom have any friends?
A brass band is marching along the street.
With just a little more effort, he would have succeeded.
You're welcome to do anything you like.
They won't come until tomorrow.
I'm not busy now.
I will wait here until he comes back.
How could it be Tom's fault?
Do you have enough food?
I can't get my tractor started.
Whose car is this?
I can't fall asleep.
I plan to catch the 10:30 train.
My sister can play the piano better than I can.
Tom had no idea why Mary didn't want to do that.
He does nothing but complain from morning till night.
What did you do last night?
I don't know if I can help.
Philosophy is not a thing one can learn in six months.
Where are you?
So what if that's true?

A little bit of luck sometimes leads to an unexpected success.
You disappointed me.
Uncle Tom is my mother's brother.
It's almost six o'clock.
She showed him to his seat.
I don't think he can help you.
I'm now working in Boston.
Tom is the manager of a small restaurant.
I'm daydreaming.
I don't eat chicken skin.
You cannot have your cake and eat it, too.
Come here quickly.
Tom works at home.
How much are you paying Tom?
That child resembles his father.
Why is Tom still at school?
Do you really believe in ghosts?
I have to explain this to Tom.
That program is now being broadcast.
You are free to go.
It's a little cold today.
I would like to improve my English pronunciation.
I hope Tom can do what we asked him to do.
Don't let Tom die.
The town was sleeping peacefully.
Most Americans do not object to my calling them by their first names.

I shouldn't have told you anything.
He had his wallet stolen.
Since I was sick, I didn't go to school.
He is a big eater.
He decided to quit smoking.
She cursed loudly.
"Is she coming, too?" "I hope so."
She is absent because of sickness.
The movie was really good.
What I want isn't tea, but coffee.

Have a good flight.
It seems she hates you.
Drive on.
The soldiers occupied the building.
How was your trip?
Tom had a heart attack last year.
While you are reading to me, I can do my sewing.
I had no idea it would put you to so much trouble.
Who told you that?
I hope I can see you at Christmas.
Did you have a good weekend?
His house is not far from here.
We had a mild winter last year.
That smells like cheese.

I can recommend this restaurant.
I think we need a doggy bag.
How many children were injured?
He did it himself.
You have three cars, don't you?
It's been snowing all night.
I was sore for three weeks.
That's avoidable.
We couldn't keep from crying.
Speaking English is difficult.
Tom was hiding something.
You must keep your eyes open.
I lost my notebook today.
That gentleman usually wears a hat.
He wants you to stay here.
What is the matter with your car?
You'll soon get accustomed to this cold weather.
Tom gave Mary a nice present.
Those women are Canadians.
He earned as much money as possible.
I am convinced that he is innocent.
I'm going to Europe next week.
The traffic accident deprived him of his sight.
The house isn't occupied now.
They say that he will never return.
I wake him up at 6 every morning.
As soon as it gets dark, the fireworks will start.
I don't blame you.
Do you think Tom will show up?
I can't look at this painting without thinking of my mom.
He held a package under his arm.
Tom probably doesn't know how to do that as well as Mary.
I followed the deer's tracks.
I have just eaten lunch.
When you hurt others, you also hurt yourself.
As the train came to a halt, all of the passengers wondered what was happening.
Tom is resting at the moment.
I was watching television when the telephone rang.
I don't want to talk to you.
I like Tom, too.
You must think I'm stupid.
Leave it to me.
I don't believe Tom's version of the story.
Money cannot buy happiness.
I went swimming in the river yesterday.
She is busy at present and can't speak to you.
I don't think he will come.

It goes without saying that health is important.
The short answer is yes.
I prefer apples to oranges.
I left it on the table.
You have to choose.

Tom pretty much forgot about the meeting.
Humans only live about 70 years.
Is it really worth it?
I don't belong to any club.
I dare say he is right.
What was that you just said?
Do you deliver on Sundays?
Tom is a normal teenager.
I was still an amateur at that time.
There are many birds in this forest.
Finally, it's Friday.
Congratulations!
We raced toward the fire.

Tom never wanted to try it.
I'd be happy to help you.
Keep it up!
What exactly happened to you?
All of us like her.
Is it difficult eating with chopsticks?
I need advice.
Tom said that he didn't think you should do that.
You guys are totally clueless.
He came several times.
I don't think anyone can do this.
How could things get worse?
Health is above wealth.
He seldom comes to see me.
I know you're upset.
Are these all your books, Tom?
It all depends on the weather.
As soon as the door opened, they ran away.
Do you know anything about Tom's parents?
She has a passion for cake.
We're traveling on a tight budget.
She lives in a two-story house.
We are all longing for peace in the world.
I'm going to check out at eight.

You can get from Washington to New York by train.
If possible, I'd like to travel around the world.
Where is the United Airlines check-in counter?
Tom says that he's willing to help.
How did you get out of your room?
If I won the lottery, I'd buy a new car.
There's all kinds of people in the world.
There's someone at the door.
Whose is this car?
Of course!
I don't want to go alone.
She must have done it yesterday.
She's sure to succeed.

Can you help me a little?
We have the same problem.
I could hardly keep from laughing.
I need help.
Do you have any plans for tonight?
I couldn't answer all of the questions.
I sat between Tom and John.
Which do you prefer, spring or autumn?
I've finished writing the letter.
I am not frightened of anything.
The bread isn't fresh.
The box wasn't empty.
I eat bread.
I just want to be happy.
This has nothing to do with you.
They are at lunch.
I wonder which way is the shortest.
Tom is a bit snobbish.
You can pick out any book you like.
Why did you use up all the money?
I want you to stay here longer.
I'll give you whatever you want.
My underpants are wet.
He commanded me to leave the room immediately.

Today is Saturday and tomorrow is Sunday.
Tom pretended to not hear a thing.
I have a terrible headache.
Tom didn't want to work in Boston.
I know why Tom is in trouble.
Tom sells T-shirts at a 30 percent discount.
Another bottle of wine, please.
Where do I pay for the gas?
He is not ashamed of being poor.
This is way better.
We hurried in the direction of the fire.
They can wait.
Tell me more about Tom.
Tom needs to go to the hospital.
I won't stay here for long.

I solved the problem easily.
How many pens do you have?
I bought two loaves of bread.
I lost my watch yesterday.
If I were invisible I wouldn't have to dress myself.
Don't play in the road.
I should've asked Tom to help.
Don't waste your time.
He did not answer the phone, so I sent him an email.
I can't decide if I'm happy or sad.
Did you buy her something for Christmas?
All you have to do is sit here.
How will the weather be tomorrow?
No matter what happens, I won't change my mind.
She drew a circle on a piece of paper with a pencil.
The baby started crying.
Be careful with it.
How did you reply?
I think I understood everything Tom said, but I'm not absolutely sure.
The school was established in 1650.
This clock loses three minutes a day.
Tomorrow I have to go shopping.
No one can help me.
How high is Mt. Fuji?
Can you please shut up?

I'm kidding.
You're a person.
I don't want to go to Tom's birthday party.
There's nothing I can do.
We went on a picnic together.
My father takes a walk every morning.
Since you're here, we might as well begin.
She thought that I was a doctor.
He lives just around the corner.
I have two brothers and three sisters.
A considerable amount of time and effort have been spent already.

I'll pay.
Would you lend me your bicycle?
Do you want to see the house?

She decided to resign from her job.
He said he did not enter the room, which was a lie.
I played tennis after school.
Can I stay here with you?
The sky was completely dark.
Tom is coming next week.
He wouldn't look at my proposal.
We must do something.
I owe a lot of money.
I certainly wouldn't want to be seen with Tom.
We spent the weekend with friends.
Be careful on your way back home.
Let me see.
Are you busy on Sunday afternoon?
What he said would happen has happened.
How about going out tonight?
Tom promised that he'd come, but he didn't.
The ship is not equipped with radar.
Come and have tea with me.
He has three sons.
I didn't go, but stayed at home.
I'm sure they'll win.
What's the matter with you?
She's on a diet.
This book is not as large that one.
The first thing you have to take into consideration is time.
We're going to be here all day.
Are they all like this?
I think I'll be able to deal with that.
It's absolutely impossible for me to go on like this.
I'm dripping with sweat.
I was puzzled about what to do next.
Someone is watching.
He has a bath every morning.
The children went out to play.
Don't ever underestimate Tom.
I'll give you a call tomorrow.
A foreign language can't be mastered in a year or so.
Why don't you take a break?
This zipper doesn't zip smoothly.
I got up early.
The old man breathed his last.
When did Tom get here?
Butter and cheese are made from milk.
We need more food.
Why do you want to kill me?
No one understands me.
I am quite ignorant of their plan.
What did you want us to do?
Do you know if my father is still in the office?
You look sleepy.
We'll meet again.
There isn't any solution.
Tom did the best he could, but he wasn't able to get a higher grade than Mary.
I don't want Tom to stay any longer.
Every rose has its thorn.
I have more books than I can read.
When I heard that song, it reminded me of when I was a kid.
The hawk caught a mouse.
Stop putting off finding a job.
That was fabulous.
What will you have for lunch today?
She used to visit me regularly.
This coffee is too hot for me to drink.
Someone yelled for help.
I'd like to go skiing with her.
Give Tom a hand.
I'll act as a guide for you.
I was surprised to see a lion.
She has a good command of English though she was brought up in Japan.
What time did you go to sleep yesterday?
I didn't know Tom was your cousin.
He said that it was nine o'clock.
One hundred years is called a century.
She walked slowly so she wouldn't slip.
Tell me about it.
I got a video cassette recorder cheap at that shop.
He has done it before.
No one can control him.
It's just started raining.
Mathematics is difficult for me.
They arrived late because of the storm.
Why are you so worried?
I saw five men.
He was completely engrossed in the book.
Please tell me why Tom was fired.
Get lost.
There's something weird happening.
I'm not well.
Even if I were rich, I wouldn't give him money.
The admission is ten dollars a person.
I want to go abroad next year.
We swam until it got dark.
Could you please lend me thirty dollars?
He crashed his car because someone tampered with the brakes.
Can you give me a discount?
I will never force you to marry him.
She runs.
No medicine can cure this disease.
She read an amusing story to the children.
We invited him to our house.
Be friendly.
Is this the first time that you've seen this movie?
Tom looked at his notes.
We work together.
Tom prepared his speech very carefully.
Do you know where I live?
She took care of the children.
He said he did not know the man, which was a lie.
He lived abroad for much of his life.
I don't like artificial flowers.
This beach is a paradise for surfers.

My neck hurts.
I warned you not to come here.
He drank three bottles of beer.
He likes watching baseball games on TV.
Stop complaining.
Do you have an extra key?
I'll wait till four o'clock.
They would've been killed if the car had gone over the cliff.
I think so, too.
I remember now.

I love this car.

I can't see anything.
With the T.V. on, how can you keep your mind on your studies?
He arrived after I had left.
There was widespread panic after the earthquake.
She fell down the ladder.
The best way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more.
How annoying!
Tom criticized Mary in front of everyone.
It's a fake.
Which of the composers do you like best?
Who gave them to you?
It's nearly six.
They made us work all day long.
He must be Tom's brother.
Will I see you tomorrow?
I was scared all the time.
I've been told that you're a very competent person.
This sentence doesn't make sense.
I have to take a test tomorrow.
What did you go to Kyoto for?
We had a heated discussion about it.
Tom has decided to become a monk.
I'm having some problems compiling this software.
The car was going forward.
Are you able to play organ?
Tom was absent yesterday.
It seems that the only time he isn't eating is when he's sleeping.
It's our pleasure.
This table is reserved.
I've already been punished.
It's about time we went to bed.
Tom asked for food.
No one came.
I'm doubling my prices.
I want to talk to you about something.
I often slept on that bench when I was homeless.
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested.
Have you ever loved a man?
It can't be!
Take it easy.
I can't put up with this smell.
That's what I always say.
Yesterday I played football.
Never forget to put out the fire.
This desk takes up too much room.
I'm a slave.
Tom probably knows where we can get something to eat around here.
I don't think that it can get any worse.
There has been a good apple harvest this year.
He asked her to marry him, and she accepted.
I want you to sleep on it.
You're too suspicious about everything.
I haven't seen you for ages.
You're too old to be doing this kind of thing.
Turn the computer on.
This is the best restaurant I know.
It would be crazy to do that again.
We want to go home.
Tom didn't give me what I asked him for.
I will be at the meeting.
How interesting!
He has a lot of money in the bank.
No other mountain in the world is so high as Mt. Everest.
He was disappointed that things didn't turn out as he'd hoped.
The United States is abundant in natural resources.
You and I have something in common.

It was love at first sight.
Do you want a drink?
We don't have another choice.
She saddled him with the work.
Tom was an Olympic swimmer.
Are you interested in foreign languages?
The girls were asleep.
We headed for the mountain cottage.
To tell the truth, I felt lonely.
How well do you know Tom?
I'd be grateful to you if you could teach me to do that.
I don't like living in the country.
Don't let appearances deceive you.
Unbelievable!
I am counting on you.
I like short poems.
Don't pull my leg!
You're probably smarter than you think.
Is there any mail for me today?
I don't know how to put it in Japanese.
People may not remember that.
I felt an impulse to cry out loud.
And what if someone sees us?
Tom didn't understand what the teacher said.
The situation is getting worse and worse day by day.
The young man is a doctor.
Please leave right away.
There is a village over the mountain.
Tom is working hard.
If you need a pen, I'll lend you one.
It's not your style.
He denied having taken part in the crime.
Why do you think I'm thinking about you?
Do you like snow?
Tom looked for his pen.
That's your responsibility.
Please let me go.
Nothing has moved.
I'm reading a book about animals.
Can I help you?
I'm shy.
She hurt her foot when she fell off her bicycle.
He took out his passport.
I have a thorn in my finger.

Everything matters.
At first, he could not speak English at all.
It looks like Tom will do what we've asked him to do.

Could you please repeat that?
He was the strongest candidate for the position.

How's business?
I am glad that you have succeeded.

That's neat.
Where is the gate?
"I like traveling." "So do I."
Let's take a trip to New York.
You're a beautiful woman.
Would you like another piece of cake?
I'm sure Tom will do his best.
I'm from Boston.
Please help me.
That's the other reason I'm here.
Quit talking, will you?
You're an optimist.
Where in Australia did you grow up?
Does this book belong to you?
I believed that he would keep his promise.

I'm asking you what you think.
The sky today is the bluest that I've ever seen it.
Do you get along with your boss?
I want to become an engineer.
I don't think that Tom is serious.
Her mother made her a new dress.
Please don't speak so fast.
Wherever she goes, she is well liked.
He hasn't come yet.

This house belongs to my uncle.
She is qualified as a nurse.
You'll find a job.
You're still young.
Who else knows about it?
Are you friends?
He often drives his father's car.
I think Tom might not want to do that.
She was asked to convince him to paint the house.
Do you have a lot of pens?
You've grown so much!
My ideas are different from yours.
You'll soon get used to Japanese food.
Tom isn't paying attention.
He even called me an idiot.
I thought that Tom would want to know about that.
I would like to tell you something.
I swim once a week.

I thought so, too.
We have no choice but to risk it.

His bag is right here, so he cannot have gone to school yet.
Suddenly, it began to rain.
What'll you do?

You're dumb.
Do you know why it's happening?
He says he won't come.
Do I need to transfer?
I want to meet your older sister.

I am staying at the hotel for the time being.
How about another beer?
I thought it best to remain silent.

People have been buying me drinks all night.
We sometimes make mistakes.
Are you happy?

I am from Shizuoka.
You only have two options.

I'm eating rice.
It turned out that the rumor was false.
Is this your family?

Look, it's my problem.
Who were you speaking with?
Your dress is very nice.
Your family's waiting for you.
They made us work all night.
What's the purpose of your trip?
Tom glanced at the clock on the wall.
Nothing is really guaranteed.
She has a husband and two daughters.
Thanks for the advice.
If you eat that much, you'll get a stomachache.
I have nothing more to do today.
I paid him the money.
She is evidently sick.
Pride cometh before a fall.
Excuse me, but where is the library?
I'm looking for a small suitcase.
"Would you like some tea?" "Yes, please."
I take care of my grandfather.
There's no money left in my bank account.
Tom would still be alive if he had been wearing his seat belt.
He is two inches taller than I am.
Are you carrying a lot of money?
I'm very glad to see you again.
All of them are not present.
I often say that to myself.
Do you have any siblings?
We had an earthquake last night.
Why do you need change?
Would you like anything to eat?
I felt quite relieved after I had said all I wanted to say.
Tom told Mary that it would probably snow all day.
The waves crashed against the rocks.

Do you know what Tom will say?
Come if you can.
It's very cold here in February.
Tom made a bet with Mary.
Would you like tea or something?
Eating lunch with you would make me happy.
Those are their books.
How long do you plan on staying here?

Tom looked well.
They say she and her husband can't agree on anything.
This is all I know.
I don't know what I should do now.
This is surprising.
He would often come to see us when I was a child.
When did he say he would come?
You seemed surprised.

That's what Tom requested.
You should apologize for your rudeness.

Were you serious about that?
What's the forecast for tomorrow?

I had lost a camera the previous day.
Whose idea was it?
He has two daughters.
